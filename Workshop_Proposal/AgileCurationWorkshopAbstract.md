#Workshop Proposal Abstract

Reusability of scientific data and reproducible science are directly connected to the ability to do the value-added work 
to generate metadata, documentation, and standardization. However, data volumes, the inclusion of software, new tools and 
techniques, distributed collaboration, limited resources, and more inhibit the timely generation of scientific data 
curation content.

When curation is considered for scientific data it is often at the end of the research process. Data curation 
traditionally follows a data life cycle approach.

However, new tools and new approaches are available to rethink approaches to data life cycle curation. These tools and 
approaches are based on two principles: 1) Move the inclusion of data management and curation as early in the research 
process as possible, and 2) to not think of data as static, but something that is dynamic with an ongoing presence.

We propose a workshop to: 1, 2, 3...
Experts from data curation, data science, and new approaches.

We believe the development and application of these concepts will have wide reaching impacts...
