#Workshop Proposal Abstract

Reusability of scientific data and reproducible science are directly connected to the ability to do the value-added work 
to generate metadata, documentation, and standardization. However, data volumes, the inclusion of software, new tools and 
techniques, distributed collaboration, limited resources, and more inhibit the timely generation of requisite scientific data 
curation content.

When curation is considered for scientific data it is often at the end of the research process. That is when a scientist publishes their research, they may then decide or be required to deposit there data in an archive or repository. At that point, many questions are raised related to provenance and curational metadata that are much more difficult to answer at the end of the process. 

Data curation traditionally follows a data life cycle approach with discretely defined steps. These steps are portrayed as linear with some feedback loops.

We argue that a new conceptualization of data curation needs to be developed. One that incorporates new tools and new approaches are available to rethink approaches to data life cycle curation. These tools and approaches are based on two principles: 1) Move the inclusion of data management and curation as early in the research process as possible, and 2) to not think of data as static, but something that is dynamic with an ongoing presence.

We propose a workshop to: 1) Bring together experts in relevant fields such as data curation, data science, library science, software carpentry, and data carpentry, 2) Systematically identify commonly understood barriers to effective data curation, 3) Explore the application of agile software development concepts and their applicability to data management, 4) Develop a case study framework, 5) Identify research issues, and 6) Propose next steps such as potential proposals, papers, or work in other forums such as RDA or EsIP.

We believe the development and application of these concepts will have wide reaching impacts improving the accessibility and reusability of science data, improving the outputs of scientific research, contributing to scientific reproducibility, and reducing the overall costs of data curation.
