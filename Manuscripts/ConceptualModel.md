## Abstract


## Introduction & Background

The processes used to develop computer software have evolved significantly since the early development of digital computing system and their applications in research and applications. The emergence of *agile software development principles* as outlined in the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* in 2001 set the stage for a recent thread in this development that focuses on

> *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
> *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
> *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
> *Responding to change* over following a plan (emphasis in original^[http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/index].

This set of principles emphasizes the importance of demonstrating value of developed capability through rapid and iterative development and release to users - delivering a product that provides incremental functionality that is defined and prioritized through frequent interaction with the users of the software. 

The recognition of the importance of research data as an important product of the research enterprise, both as the raw material upon which increasingly data intensive research is based (
