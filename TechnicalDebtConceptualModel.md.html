<p>The concept of <em>debt</em> in software development was introduced in 1992 by Ward Cunningham in the context of the adoption of object-oriented principles in the development of financial software. In his formulation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite. Objects make the cost of this transaction tolerable. The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. {Cunningham, 1992 #2427, p. 30}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cunningham focused on the development flexibility that is gained by accepting some degree of technical debt that is understood to require repayment some time in the future.</p>
<p>With the emergence of agile software development methods based upon the principles and spirit of the <em>Manifesto for Agile Software Development</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Individuals and interactions</em> over processes and tools <em>Working software</em> over comprehensive documentation <em>Customer collaboration</em> over contract negotiation <em>Responding to change</em> over following a plan</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.{Beck, 2001 #2428}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tradeoffs presented in the <em>Manifesto</em> provide opportunities to accrue technical debt throughout an agile software development process that has been recognized as a challenge that must be addressed when adopting agile methods. As noted by dos Santos et al.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technical debt has been a central theme among researchers and practitioners in the last years as an alternative perspective for software development and maintenance decisions. It offers a real world metaphor which is naturally understandable by mose software stakeholders and serves as tool to evaluate the tradeoffs between proposed enhancements, corrective maintenance and technical/non-functional improvements. {dos Santos, 2013 #2426, p. 124}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we consider the application of agile development models to the process of data curation, the concept of technical debt may prove useful when attempting to identify the requirements for and progress towards enabling reuse of research data for communities of users and uses beyond those for which data were initially collected or created.</p>
