## Anticipated Contributors, Participants



## Themes and Scope

[Link to online listing.](http://www.scidatacon.org/site/themes-scope/)

Addressing major research questions from the perspective of data issues.  This includes research into:

* data availability and data quality for research;
* disciplinary and interdisciplinary case studies of data issues, data (non-)availability, barriers and solutions; 

The discussion of such data issues should relate concretely and directly to specific research questions.
Data Science and Data Analysis

Addressing the frontier scientific, technical and epistemological challenges associated with data in research.  This includes research into:

* issues around reproducibility, statistical and technical challenges in data intensive research;
* data science and infrastructures for Big Data;
* interoperability standards in data and metadata, including brokering and mediation;
* data systems architecture; and so on.

Data Stewardship

Addressing issues to advance sustainable, long-term data stewardship.  This includes research into:

* data management and curation systems and practice;
* developing institutional, national and international data repositories and services;
* sustainability of data infrastructure;
* long term digital preservation;
* data stewardship in the research lifecycle and in research infrastructures;

Policy and Practice of Data in Research

Addressing research into data policies and practice, and the role of data in scholarly communications.  This includes research into:

* data policy development and harmonization;
* costs, value proposition, business models and economics of data infrastructure;
    mapping the limits of Open Data;
    data publication and citation;
    research data and scholarly communications;
    motivations, recognitions and reward in research practice; and so on.

Education and Data

Addressing research into educational and training responses to the Data Revolution.  This includes research into:

* capacity building and education in data science, data management and data handling;
* curricula and competency frameworks for data in research; and so on.

Data, Society, Ethics and Politics

Addressing research into the broader dimensions of data and data driven research in relation to society.  This includes research into:

## Open research data and Open public data;

Session Organizers:

* Karl Benedict (University of New Mexico)
* W Christopher Lehnhardt (RENCI)
* Joshua Young (NCAR)

## Initial organizing thoughts:

* Conceptual overview based on continued evolution of ideas from paper/lit review
* Community concepts of agile curation
  * Test-driven curation (participant in our RDA P6 BOF [from Germany])
  * Adaptive and product-driven (Denise)
* Case studies as a vehicle for developing *design patterns*
* Initial synthesis strategy and results from *design pattern* work.
