# Session Title (300 characters)

Agile data curation as a strategy for maximizing the value of research data while minimizing the cost of research data management.

# Session Description (150 words)

Software engineering has seen the widespread adoption of agile development practices that are based on the core values and associated principles of embodied in the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*^(http://agilemanifesto.org/). The use of agile methods in software development has enabled more responsive and user-engaged processes that in many instances have been able to produce improved products in less time than in previously used development models. Agile development values and principles may be mapped into the process of research data management and curation, with the hoped for outcome of more producing more efficient data management during research activities while also lowering the effort (and cost) of increasing the value of research data products for future unanticipated uses and users. This session's objective is to bring together a set of papers that represent two aspects of agile data curation: 1) identifying the conceptual models that embody the application of agile software development values and principles in the context of research data management, and 2) examples of intentional or unintentional agile data curation that illustrate the strategies that may be employed in maximizing the value of research data both for the original research teams and for future users of those data.

Software engineering has seen the adoption of agile development practices that are based on the values and principles embodied in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. Agile methods in software development have yielded responsive and user-engaged processes that have produced improved products in less time compared to other development models. These values and principles may be mapped into research data management and curation, with the outcome of yielding more efficient data management during research and lowering the effort (and cost) of maximizing the value of research data products for unanticipated uses and users. This session will bring together papers related to two aspects of agile data curation: 1) conceptual models that embody agile development values and principles in the context of research data management, and 2) examples of intentional or unintentional agile data curation that illustrate strategies that may be employed in maximizing the current and future value of research.
