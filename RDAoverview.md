### Agenda - Context

Introduction

* Background regarding the genesis of this effort, work to date.
* Why Agile?

Presentations on Agile Curation Case Studies and Examples of the Technical Debt Model

* Provide a template for both documenting an A.C. case study and a T.D.M. example (the T.D.M example may contribute to an Agile Curation case study but not all T.D.M. examples will constitute a case study) - [http://goo.gl/P7wuFY](http://goo.gl/P7wuFY)
<!-- 
	* Case studies can be used for comparative analysis of real-world data curation
	* Case studies can be used to validate the abstract model
	* Opportunity to start the conversation with concrete examples[e]
	* Showing / learning how curation can evolve
 -->

Examples

* GSToRE and RDS at UNM
* Sea Ice as an Agile Curation example
* Others???

### Agenda - Where from Here?

Discussion / Next Steps

* Identify more case studies
* Examples of agile curation
* Data reuse examples with an explicit consideration of investments required to facilitate data reuse
* How far can the agile model go when applied to data curation?

BoF Results

* Discuss the potential for a white paper or publication
* Outline paper / writing assignments / timetable
* Does the group want to continue as an RDA IG.

### Background

* Conversations started at GeoData 2014 and continued at the ESIP Federation Summer 2014 meeting
* Poster presented at the 2014 AGU Fall meeting to broaden the dialog - [http://www.slideshare.net/JoshYoung8/ag-cu-11](http://www.slideshare.net/JoshYoung8/ag-cu-11)

### Why Agile? 

Key Ideas Presented in the AGU Poster

Research data management and curation is
 
* resource constrained
* dynamic
* may require expertise/knowledge beyond the research team that is creating the data

While agile development includes methods and practices, it also embodies a fundamentally *different philosophical approach* as embodied in the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*

### Manifesto for Agile Software Development {#manifesto}

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

> **Responding to change** over following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more. [http://agilemanifesto.org/](http://agilemanifesto.org/). 

### Assumptions for Agile Curation

1. Access to data is the first goal
2. Generative value is supported (Zittrain, 2006)
3. Researcher involvement through a participatory framework that aligns data management with scientific research processes (Yarmey and Baker, 2013)
4. Projects will utilize free open-source resources to the greatest extent practical
5. Community participation increases project capacity
6. Data management requirements and practices evolve as the research project proceeds
7. Bright and dedicated individuals can learn appropriate skills and respond to the demands of their particular project, as they proceed
8. Approaches apply across scales
9. Consider technical debt when making data management and curation decisions
10. Data evaluation can be conducted through use and feedback

- based on the Agile Underlying Assumptions found in Turke, et al (2002)


### Technical Debt 

The evolving technical debt conceptual model can be found at: [https://github.com/karlbenedict/agilecuration](https://github.com/karlbenedict/agilecuration)
