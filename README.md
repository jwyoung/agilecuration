# agilecuration

A repository for our group to develop materials around the concept of agile data curation

The document source files are written in the version of Markdown (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) supported by the Pandoc document processor (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). The following file types are generated by running the `generate.sh` script (or the individual `pandoc` commands contained therein):

* .pdf
* .docx
* .pdf

with the filenames corresponding the the source .md filename.
